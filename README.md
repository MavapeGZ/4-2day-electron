# 4 2Day! Local App

### About 4 2Day!

- This is a project developed by Mario Vázquez Pérez for the **Quality Management in IT** subject at the **University of Oradea**.
- The main goal of this project is to create to-do task lists where the user can add and delete tasks to organize the day.
- The project compares the performance of this app using local storage versus using a database (this is the Electron version).
- To run this project by yourself, you only need to download the project and run it on your favorite browser.
